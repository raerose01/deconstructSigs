\title{Converts mutation list to correct input format}
\usage{
mut.to.sigs.input(
  mut.ref,
  sample.id = "Sample",
  chr = "chr",
  pos = "pos",
  ref = "ref",
  alt = "alt",
  bsg = NULL,
  chr.list = NULL,
  sig.type = "SBS"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{mut.ref}{Location of the mutation file that is to be converted or name
of data frame in environment}

\item{sample.id}{Column name in the mutation file corresponding to the Sample
ID}

\item{chr}{Column name in the mutation file corresponding to the chromosome}

\item{pos}{Column name in the mutation file corresponding to the mutation
position}

\item{ref}{Column name in the mutation file corresponding to the reference
base}

\item{alt}{Column name in the mutation file corresponding to the alternate
base}

\item{bsg}{Only set if another genome build is required. Must be a BSgenome
object.}

\item{chr.list}{what targetedd chromosome should be used in the analysis.
Default: NULL, means all chromosome}

\item{sig.type}{Are SBS or DBS signatures being used?}
}
\value{
A data frame that contains sample IDs for the rows and trinucleotide
  contexts for the columns. Each entry is the count of how many times a
  mutation with that trinucleotide context is seen in the sample.
}
\description{
Given a mutation list, outputs a data frame with counts of how frequently a
mutation is found within each trinucleotide context per sample ID.  Output
can be used as input into getTriContextFraction.
}
\details{
The context sequence is taken from the BSgenome.Hsapiens.UCSC.hgX::Hsapiens
object. Therefore the coordinates must correspond to the human hgX assembly.
Default is set to the UCSC hg19 assembly, which corresponds to the GRCh37
assembly. If another assembly is required, it must already be present in the
R workspace and fed as a parameter. This method will translate chromosome
names from other versions of the assembly like NCBI or Ensembl. For instance,
the following transformation will be done: "1" -> "chr1"; "MT" -> "chrM";
"GL000245.1" -> "chrUn_gl000245"; etc.

\usage{
whichSignatures(tumor.ref = NA, sample.id, signatures.ref = signatures,
  associated = c(), signatures.limit = NA, signature.cutoff = 0.06,
  contexts.needed = FALSE, trimer.counts.loc)
}
\arguments{
\item{tumor.ref}{Either a data frame or location of input text file, where
rows are samples, columns are trinucleotide contexts}

\item{sample.id}{Name of sample -- should be rowname of tumor.ref}

\item{signatures.ref}{Either a data frame or location of signature text file,
where rows are signatures, columns are trinucleotide contexts}

\item{associated}{Vector of associated signatures. If given, will narrow the 
signatures tested to only the ones listed.}

\item{signatures.limit}{Number of signatures to limit the search to}

\item{signature.cutoff}{Discard any signature contributions with a weight
less than this amount}

\item{contexts.needed}{FALSE if tumor.file is a context file, TRUE if it is
only mutation counts}

\item{trimer.counts.loc}{Location of counts of trinucleotides in region 
covered by sequencing. Only required if contexts.needed = TRUE .}
}
\value{
A list of the weights for each signatures, the product when those are
  multiplied on the signatures, the difference between the tumor sample and 
  product, the tumor sample tricontext distribution given, and the unknown
  weight.
}
\description{
Determines how much of each signature is present in the sample given
}
\examples{
test = whichSignatures(tumor.ref = randomly.generated.tumors,

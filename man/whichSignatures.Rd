\usage{
whichSignatures(tumor.ref = NA, sample.id,
  signatures.ref = signatures.nature2013, associated = c(),
  signatures.limit = NA, signature.cutoff = 0.06,
  contexts.needed = FALSE, tri.counts.method = "default")
}
\arguments{
\item{tumor.ref}{Either a data frame or location of input text file, where 
rows are samples, columns are trinucleotide contexts}

\item{sample.id}{Name of sample -- should be rowname of tumor.ref. Optional
if the tumor.ref contains one single sample}

\item{signatures.ref}{Either a data frame or location of signature text file,
where rows are signatures, columns are trinucleotide contexts}

\item{associated}{Vector of associated signatures. If given, will narrow the 
signatures tested to only the ones listed.}

\item{signatures.limit}{Number of signatures to limit the search to}

\item{signature.cutoff}{Discard any signature contributions with a weight 
less than this amount}

\item{contexts.needed}{FALSE if tumor.file is a context file, TRUE if it is 
only mutation counts}

\item{tri.counts.method}{Set to either:
\itemize{
 \item 'default' -- no further normalization \item 'exome' -- normalized by
  number of times each trinucleotide context is observed in the exome \item
  'genome' -- normalized by number of times each trinucleotide context is
  observed in the genome \item 'exome2genome' -- multiplied by a ratio of that
  trinucleotide's occurence in the genome to the trinucleotide's occurence in
  the exome \item 'genome2exome' -- multiplied by a ratio of that
  trinucleotide's occurence in the exome to the trinucleotide's occurence in
  the genome \item data frame containing user defined scaling factor -- count
  data for each trinucleotide context is multiplied by the corresponding value
  given in the data frame }}
}
\value{
A list of the weights for each signatures, the product when those are
  multiplied on the signatures, the difference between the tumor sample and 
  product, the tumor sample tricontext distribution given, and the unknown 
  weight.
}
\description{
Determines how much of each signature is present in the sample given
}
\section{Normalization}{
 If the input data frame only contains the counts of
  the mutations observed in each context, then the data frame must be
  normalized. In these cases, the value of `contexts.needed` should be TRUE.
  \cr The parameter, `tri.counts.method`, determines any additional
  normalization performed. Any user provided data frames should match the
  format of `tri.counts.exome` and `tri.counts.genome`. \cr The method of
  normalization chosen should match how the input signatures were normalized.
  For exome data, the 'exome2genome' method is appropriate for the signatures
  included in this package. For whole genome data, use the 'default' method
  to obtain consistent results.
